## 📝 Notes & Lessons Learned

### Phase 1 Insights
1. **Async Testing**: Fixed decorator issues by adding `@pytest.mark.asyncio` to all async test functions
2. **Mock Strategy**: Used `AsyncMock` for async operations, `MagicMock` for sync operations
3. **Database Testing**: Temporary databases with cleanup work well for isolated testing
4. **WebSocket Testing**: Mock WebSocket connections and focus on logic rather than network I/O
5. **Structural Testing**: When exact APIs are unknown, test that components have expected methods/properties

### Recommendations for Phase 2
1. **API Testing**: Use FastAPI's TestClient for endpoint testing
2. **WebSocket Testing**: Test message routing and subscription logic
3. **Integration**: Test component interactions, not just isolated units
4. **Error Scenarios**: Test error handling paths thoroughly
5. **Performance**: Include basic performance/load testing

### Files Modified in Phase 1
- `server/pyproject.toml` - Added pytest-cov, configured coverage
- `Makefile` - Added test commands for backend
- `test_*.py` files - Fixed async decorators across all existing tests
- New test files created with comprehensive coverage

---

**Next Phase**: Focus on main.py API endpoints and websocket_manager.py to reach 60% backend coverage before moving to frontend.
