# Architecture Design Records (ADR)

This directory contains architectural design records for the ALP Experimental telescope control application.

## Purpose

Architecture Design Records document important architectural decisions, technical explorations, and design trade-offs made during development. They serve as:

- Historical context for design decisions
- Technical reference for implementation details
- Guidance for future architectural changes
- Documentation of alternatives considered and rejected

## Format

Each ADR should include:
- **Problem/Context**: What architectural challenge or decision needed to be made
- **Decision**: What approach was chosen
- **Rationale**: Why this approach was selected
- **Consequences**: Trade-offs, benefits, and limitations
- **Implementation Details**: Technical specifics and test results

## Current Records

- [`webrtc-test-results.md`](./webrtc-test-results.md) - WebRTC streaming architecture evaluation and MediaMTX integration testing

## Guidelines

When creating new ADRs:
1. Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `streaming-architecture-decision.md`)
2. Include date and context in the document
3. Document both successful and unsuccessful approaches
4. Update this README with new records
5. Link to related code, configurations, and test results
